Blockade enables you to set a priority level on the event queue. This allows you to handle events later or discard them completely when dispatched with lower priority than the current priority level on the event queue. This can be handy in situations where you want to lock down the system and not process any events for some duration of time. In such cases, you can set a high priority level. Later, when the system is ready to handle events again, you can lower the priority level, and the queued events will be automatically dispatched (unless the discard_events option is set to true ). Blockade is built on top of the Erlang pg module, which means it will work in a distributed environment. Each node starts the blockade supervisor with the same name parameter. When dispatching events, the events will be received by all subscribers across the cluster. Please read the documentation for the blockade module for more information on the available functions.","ref":"readme.html#description","title":"Blockade - Description","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Blockade can be started under supervision tree in your application.
